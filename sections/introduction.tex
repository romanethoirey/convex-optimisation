This report will show how to use the Hessian matrix to determine if solutions
to an optimization problem are optimal. 
We will introduce the relevant mathematical theory, a concrete case study of
two functions, and then provide details of a Python implementation that performs
a version of steepest-descent, validating the solutions using the Hessian methods.

As a small introductory background, below we see a picture of German
mathematician Ludwig Otto Hesse (born in 1811):

Hesse has given name to the Hessian matrix, which will be the subject of study
in this report~\cite{hessian_wiki}.
The report is finished by a section which compares the
case study with the implementation results.
